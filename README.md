# Big Image Fixer - Joomla Plugin
This is a Joomla Plugin to fix big images

https://github.com/AndyGaskell/joomla_plugin_bigimagefixer

This plugin will, on save, reduce overly large images that may have been added to content.  The idea came from a chat with Pete Rosetti at J & Beyond in 2017.  It seemed like a simple solution for a problem that comes up somtimes.  The problem is that sometimes an inexpeienced CMS user will upload images without resizing them for web use, which can result in very large page sizes.  These large images are often not noticed by users due to css limiting image size to 100%, or similar template code.  So, in a sense, the plug-in provides a bit of insurance against that happening.
